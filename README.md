# Digit-Recognizer-using-Deep-learning-CNN-with-Keras

The Jupyter notebook goes through the Kaggle Digit-Recognizer(mnist) dataset via a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Python and its Powerful Library in deep learning,Keras, and finishes with making a submission.

Keras is a Python Library thas uses Tensor-Flow in Backend, with keras these task would be a little easier.
